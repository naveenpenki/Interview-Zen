    "Our operating system will be shipping with an internet browser. One of the core components of an internet browser is the ability to parse links on buttons and `<a>` tags, as well as maintain a history list with back/forward behavior. Today, you're going to implement that behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Given a stream of href links, backward operations, or forward operations, output a stream of the full url the browser should visit after each event in the input stream._\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background: Href Links\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will provide you with some background on href links in browsers. There are three valid forms of href links that may appear in the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Absolute URLs, like `https://google.com`. These are identified by the URL scheme in the front, which you may assume is always `https://`.\n",
    "2. Absolute Paths, like `/search`. These are identified by a leading forward-slash (`/`).\n",
    "3. Relative Paths, like `query`. These are identified through the virtue of being neither of the former types of links.\n",

    "- Absolute Paths and Relative Paths provided may contain more than one path component, such as `/r/programming` (the path components here include `r` and `programming`, separated by forward slashes). \n",
    "- You may assume that path components in Absolute and Relative paths follow the regex `[A-Za-z0-9]+`. More specifically, this means you do not have to handle the interesting security concern of properly handling `..` characters in paths.\n",
    "- You may assume that `BACK` and `FORWARD` operations will always occur at times when they make sense. For example, a `BACK` operation makes no sense as the first operation in the stream, and a `FORWARD` operation makes no sense without a previously occurring `BACK` operation.\n",

    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Many standard libraries include functionality to do this url parsing and following for you. In some very popular langauges, a partial solution to this problem could be a only two or three lines. **Stay away from any url or http functionality in your standard libraries**. You might earn a few points for doing it the way you should totally do this on the job, but we're interested in how you think through the logic and the data structures you use to make this happen. \n",
    "- That being said, if there's a way to do it with a standard library function, feel free to talk it out in the comments alongside your actual solution. You may earn bonus points for identifying that functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- What you're being asked to build here essentially conforms to a sub-set of the functionality defined in IETF RFC 3986 Section 5 - \"Reference Resolution\".\n",
    "- The assumptions outlined above significantly limit the scope of what you're required to build to be simpler, but anything above-and-beyond and still outlined in that RFC will be eligible for bonus points.\n",
    "- Take care: the strings `BACK` and `FORWARD` are technically valid relative paths. Your solution needs to ensure that they are not treated as such, and instead are treated as special operations with different logic."
